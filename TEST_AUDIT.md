# Test Audit: Flow Boundary

Date: 2026-08-29
Classification: frontend + cli Omarchy plugin
Audit harness: 1.3.1
Registry: `sha256:ffbc75700fb5eb501cb47f1e4038f47ab95ae1fba534b38095e1fe7820c80ed1`

## Result

Grade: A (96/100)

The initial deterministic audit found four testing-depth gaps: accessibility,
E2E, smoke, and a conditional web-contract heuristic. The contract heuristic is
not applicable because Flow Boundary has no API or network boundary. E2E and
smoke now pass the harness. Accessibility is implemented with QML roles, names,
and static assertions; audit-harness 1.3.1 still reports it as advisory because
its presence detector recognizes only browser axe packages.

## Layer coverage

| Layer | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| L1 hooks and CI | Implemented | pre-push gates; exact npm test, race, mutation, audit, and ShellCheck in Actions |
| L2 static | Implemented | Perl compile, ShellCheck, actionlint, npm audit, gitleaks, vendored gates |
| L3 unit | Implemented | node:test, c8, Stryker, CRAP, race stability |
| L4 integration | Implemented | real helper subprocesses and filesystem fixtures |
| L5 system/security/a11y | Implemented | same-UID racers, path confinement, FIFO, bounds, QML accessibility contract |
| L6 smoke/E2E/visual | Implemented | stock runtime smoke plus Buzz validator, live load, IPC open, screenshot |
| L7 acceptance | Implemented | two critical journeys, both 100% mapped |

## Gaps

P0: 0 after implementation
P1: 0 after QML-specific adaptation
P2: 0

## Traceability

Eight requirements are mapped: seven MUST and one SHOULD. All are covered.
Both personas and both critical journeys have 100% mapped coverage. No tests are
orphaned.

## Final evidence

- 19/19 tests and 100% Model.js statements, branches, functions, and lines
- Three consecutive adversarial helper-suite passes with zero flake
- 95.74% mutation score with a 90% blocking floor
- 11/11 canonical Omarchy gates and a current vendored lane
- Zero npm vulnerabilities; actionlint, ShellCheck, Perl syntax, and gitleaks clean
- Buzz: validator 0, qmllint 0, live load clean, IPC panel open, curated render inspected

The harness's optional OSV and markdownlint executables are not installed in the
local environment. Dependency authority is enforced by npm audit, and this repo
has fewer than 50 Markdown files with no documentation corpus, so the doc-lint
overlay is not applicable. The harness link check passes.
